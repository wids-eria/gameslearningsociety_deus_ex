                <p class="bio_paragraph">
                    Rich Halverson is a Professor in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis at the University
                    of Wisconsin-Madison. His work involves documenting the practical wisdom of school
                    leaders with the tools and ideas of distributed leadership, and understanding how
                    digital media tools (can) change teaching and learning in schools.
                    <br /><br />
                    He co-directs two federally funded projects that guide his research. First, he works
                    with Kurt Squire on the National Science Foundation funded CyberSTEM project,
                    which develops video-games for learning and investigates how the data that
                    results from game-play can become evidence for learning and a catalyst for
                    social interaction.
                    <br /><br />
                    Second, he works with Carolyn Kelley on the Institute for Education Sciences
                    funded Collaborative Assessment of Leadership for Learning (CALL) project
                    to develop an on-line 360-degree formative feedback system to inform and
                    support the work of school leaders. From 2004-2009, he directed a study funded
                    by a National Science Foundation Early Career Award to investigate how school
                    leaders work with teachers to create the capacity for using student achievement
                    data to improve teaching and learning.
