                <p class="bio_paragraph">
                    Becky Torrisi is a Project Manager at Learning Games Network, Inc. She
                    spends a majority of her time on financial and grant administration,
                    but is involved in multiple grant projects as well. Her expertise
                    in web-based administrative system development and process improvement
                    was gained from ten years as a system developer at the University of
                    Wisconsin-Madison’s College of Engineering. Prior to that, she spent
                    many years in office administration which provided invaluable insight
                    when it came to helping people re-think office processes. She received
                    a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Information Systems from Edgewood
                    College in 2007.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Torrisi has always cared deeply about improving education. She worked as a
                    volunteer at the Wisconsin Center for Gifted Learners in Milwaukee for more
                    than 20 years, and spent time at the National Institute for Science Education.
                    When the opportunity to work for an organization that is changing education
                    through digital games presented itself, she jumped at it.
