                            Videogames have captured much national attention as a powerful learning technology.
                            Research across areas as disparate as perception, attention, science, literacy,
                            language learning, history, computer science, and curriculum design suggests that
                            videogames are not only engaging but, if designed well and placed in the right
                            context, good for thinking and learning as well. In this three-credit course, we
                            will discuss current research on the kinds of intellectual work that goes into
                            videogaming; how games and their culture foster complex forms of knowledge, skills,
                            and dispositions; and how games can be designed to capitalize on this capacity for
                            educational ends. We'll investigate the benefits and drawbacks of this digital gameplay,
                            covering everything from perception and attention in first person shooters to the development
                            of historical understanding in games like the Civilization series, from sociocultural
                            learning in massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft to computational
                            reasoning in titles like Kodu, from the inherent tensions between contemporary youth
                            culture and traditional education to new developments in games for learning intended
                            to bridge that growing divide.

                            This course meets Comm B requirements, so it is writing intensive. Throughout the semester, you will
                            gain familiarity with current research on course topics, develop a language for reflection on the
                            cognitive and educational merits and drawbacks of growing up on games and gaming culture, and gain
                            new insights into the ways in which your digital playspaces and pastimes shape how you (and your peers)
                            think and learn.

                            Design-based research (DBR), first articulated in the 90s, is an educational research methodology (or a
                            family of affiliated methods) that addresses unique challenges in education. DBR evolved in response to
                            the complex nature of learning in situated contexts, the "applied" (or design) nature of education as a
                            field, and a recognition of the political dimensions of research, such as the necessity to include teachers'
                            and students' voices. It has been a guiding methodology for several major programs of research, and has led
                            to pedagogies such as Learning By Design and products such as Quest Atlantis. Researchers in games often use
                            it as a framework for developing and researching technologies and pedagogies in complex learning ecologies.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            DBR is not without its critics. Debates on the success of DBR can be traced to differing models of inquiry,
                            differing notions of what constitutes knowledge and how findings are best presented and communicated, and
                            perhaps most importantly, differing theories of change for how social systems operate. Critics of DBR claim
                            that it isn't a methodology, that hasn't produced compelling findings, isn't a science, and hasn't led to
                            changes in education. Meanwhile, DBR practitioners often believe that education is a complex system that
                            requires multi-dimensional and multi-faceted approaches to change. Many DBR practitioners believe that
                            change occurs through proof of concept products as much as research papers, and that researchers might benefit
                            by creating the change they wish to study. After 20 years, DBR should be critically analyzed to understand
                            its success and failures as a method.

                        <p>
                            In this course, we will examine DBR in its philosophical and historical contexts. We will examine
                            examples of DBR and tackle DBR projects of our own. Through the course, you will gain better understanding
                            of DBR, the issues and challenges facing DBR researchers, and issues in educational research more generally.

                            This course investigates how school leaders develop and use technologies to improve student learning.
                            The role of technology in school leadership has changed in recent years from supporting the technologies
                            school leaders and teachers use in their work to how leaders develop and manage complex technological
                            systems to effect change in schools.

                            The course will be organized around two central issues: how learning technologies are used and developed
                            in the world, and how learning technologies fit into schools. The first issue will address the radical
                            changes that digital technologies have made in the daily lives of students, teachers and citizens - ranging
                            from video gaming and mobile, to social networking and media design. The second addresses the technological
                            challenges faced by leaders interested in creating the schools of tomorrow - how leaders build on the
                            technological capacity of existing schools to improve learning for students.

                        <p>
                            Course activities and readings will focus on recent research on technology, learning and leadership
                            and hands-on investigations of the technologies that shape schools and learning. We will study and use
                            technologies to facilitate planning, promote and measure student learning, and administrative technologies
                            to assess and organize student learning. We will also examine how technologies such as virtual schools,
                            video games, mobile and wireless technologies will reframe the future of schooling and learning. Our
                            investigations will take account of the ways technologies frame and are framed by institutional cultures.
                            The seminar format will emphasize the experiences of participants in the conduct and topics addressed
                            in the course.

                            At the TechBoston event in March 2011, President Obama issued a call to action, stating	
                            “I’m calling for investments in educational technology that will help create…educational	
                            software that’s as compelling as the	best video game. I want you guys to be stuck
                            on a video game that’s teaching you something other than just blowing something up.” A
                            growing number of universities, companies, and philanthropic organizations have risen to
                            the challenge, establishing programs not only in game studies but also in game design and
                            development. Robust communities such as Games for Change, Games for Health, and
                            Games+Learning+Society have also mobilized around the idea that games could indeed be
                            leveraged against grand challenges that range from improving healthcare and wellness to
                            teaching physics to making new discoveries in the structure of proteins. The evidence for
                            this approach is quickly growing, and the Federal government has emerged as a key partner
                            in this wave of innovation.

                             In this seminar, we will review the state of play in the games for impact area, the role
                             of various stakeholders (federal government, universities, philanthropy, and industry)
                             in this domain, and both opportunities and challenges to the movement. The goal of
                             this course is twofold. First, it will serve as a way for me to share with advanced
                             graduate students the knowledge and experience I’ve gained over the last year while
                             on leave from academics to work in the White House Office of Science and Technology
                             Policy (OSTP) as a senior policy analyst focused on national initiatives related to
                             games for change. By the end of this course you should have a better understanding of
                             how various White House offices and federal agencies work, and how you as an emerging
                             scholar might contribute to those agency initiatives and policies.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Second, the course will function as a “do tank” (to borrow a term from Beth Noveck)
                            in contrast to a “think tank.” Through the semester, you will do actual domain work
                            of immediate relevance for various stakeholders including a landscape analysis of
                            the various subareas within the games for impact domain and a draft pitch for new
                            projects and partnerships that should exist and don’t yet. This course is biased
                            toward getting stuff done in the world, right now. It is based on an apprenticeship
                            model that assumes that learning arises through joint activity with an expert. Expect
                            to engage in collaborative work with an audience that extends beyond the classroom walls.

                            Discourse analysis is a method of closely examining language in order to connect the micro-dynamics
                            of language-in-use with the macro-dynamics of culture and society. Discourse analysis approaches
                            language as action and affiliation, attending to both the content of what is said as well as its
                            structure or the way in which it is said (which is, in fact, also part of its content) across
                            the idea unit (clause), the sentence, the paragraph, and even longer pieces of text. By unveiling
                            the work that is done through language in social interaction, discourse analysis functions as a
                            particularly powerful means for examining, for example, the actual activities that participants
                            are involved in, the value structures in play, and the identities that are being performed.

                            The goal of this course is to develop a deeper understanding of and facility with Discourse Analysis
                            as a means for analyzing language in use, particularly in the context of teaching and learning in
                            both formal and informal contexts. Throughout the semester, we will apply a range of discourse
                            analysis techniques that enable the researcher to empirically document and assess the mechanisms
                            by which individuals collaborate, establish intersubjectivity, share their understandings, and
                            learn from one another. Students in the course will engage in weekly data analysis sessions
                            as a way to develop their own skills in the methods covered which will culminate in a final
                            course project.

                            Games are both designed object but also emergent social practice, and it is both aspects of
                            games that make them a powerful “sociotechnical” means of learning. In this course, we will
                            examine how game communities function as naturally occurring, self-sustaining, indigenous
                            online communities of learning and practice, the conditions under which such learning happens,
                            its means, and its ends. Throughout the semester, we review sociocultural theories of
                            learning, current research on game communities, and methodologies for their investigation.

                            Computer and video games have emerged as a model for learning and instruction. Theorists
                            look toward game as a model for developing educational innovations based on situated
                            learning theory. Policy makers embrace the potential for games to reach broad impact,
                            leveraging the substantial industry talent developed over the last 30 years. For teachers
                            and students, the promise of engaging, effective game-based curricula is alluring.

                            This course provides an overview of major debates, concepts, and issues in digital
                            games. It provides students opportunities to confront foundational ideas in a deep
                            and sustained way. First and foremost, it approaches games on their own terms,
                            seeking to understand how they operate on their own terms, before seeking to apply
                            them directly to education.

                            It is not expected that you be fluent in games, but it is expected that you’re familiar
                            with (1) Gee’s theories of learning and literacy through games, and (2) canonical games
                            and genres. This course is an opportunity to explore new games and genres, and it is
                            expected that everyone will bring experiences from their game play to discussion.
                            Discussing new or current (or classic) games (or other interesting immersive digitally
                            mediated experiences) is expected to constitute a substantive portion of the course.
